# Project 4: Distributed Systems

Project 4 for the Spring 2018 Operating Systems course at Kansas State University. In this project,
we were given the task of finding the least common substring between wikipedia entries, in a text file
that contained 1 million wikipedia entries. We had to parallelize this operation using openMP, pThreads,
and MPI, then analyze the difference in performance between the 3 (which can be found in 'Design4.pdf').
